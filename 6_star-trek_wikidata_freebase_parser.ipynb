      "Description: Star Trek: Insurrection is a 1998 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures. It is the ninth film in the Star Trek film franchise and the second film to exclusively feature the cast of the Star Trek: The Next Generation television series. In addition to that cast, F. Murray Abraham, Donna Murphy and Anthony Zerbe also appeared in main roles. The crew of the USS Enterprise-E rebel against Starfleet after they discover a conspiracy with a species known as the Son'a to steal the peaceful Ba'ku's planet for its rejuvenating properties.\n",
      "Paramount Studios sought a change in pace after the previous film, Star Trek: First Contact. Michael Piller was asked to write the script, which was created from story ideas by Piller and executive producer Rick Berman. The story's first drafts featured the Romulans, and the Son'a and Ba'ku were introduced in the third draft. After Ira Steven Behr reviewed the script, Piller revised it and added a subplot involving a romantic interest for Captain Picard. The ending was further revised after test screenings.\n",
      "The special effects depicting outer space were completely computer generated, a first for a Star Trek film.\n",

Although he searches for a way to return, he finally decides to live his life with his Kataan wife, have children & grandchildren, learning to play a flute and completely immersing in the Kataan culture. He finds the planet is dying due to an imbalance of its sun.  With no way to evacuate the planet's people, the government builds a probe which will tell others how they lived.  The same probe that Picard met.  Picard wakes to find himself back on the Enterprise having lived an entire lifetime in just minutes.  The probe, having disgorged its memories, gives one last gift:  the flute (which shows up in later episodes.)\n",

The episode was written by freelance writer Morgan Gendel based on his original pitch. Gendel is credited as writer of the story and co-writer of the teleplay with Peter Allan Fields. It is the penultimate episode of the season and was first broadcast on June 1, 1992. The episode is widely considered by critics and fans as one of the best episodes of the entire Star Trek franchise. In 1993, \"The Inner Light\" won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. The flute melody, featured prominently in the episode, was composed by Jay Chattaway and has since been re-arranged for a full orchestra.\n",

It is the first film based on Star Trek, and a sequel to the Star Trek television series. The film is set in the twenty-third century, when a mysterious and immensely powerful alien cloud called V'Ger approaches Earth, destroying everything in its path. Admiral James T. Kirk assumes command of his previous starship—the recently refitted USS Enterprise—to lead it on a mission to save the planet and determine V '​Ger '​s origins.\n",
      "When the original television series was cancelled in 1969, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry lobbied Paramount to continue the franchise through a film. The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on a feature film in 1975. A series of writers attempted to craft a suitably epic script, but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series, Star Trek: Phase II.\n",

      "Description: \"The Menagerie\" is a two-part episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek. It consists of episodes 11 and 12 of the show's first season, and is the only two-part story in the original series. Part one of the episode was broadcast on November 17, 1966, and the second part was broadcast on November 24, 1966. NBC repeated the two shows on May 18 and 25, 1967. The episode's screenplay was written by Gene Roddenberry. Since the true 1965 pilot episode \"The Cage\" was not shown on television until 1988 and the original series began with the second pilot \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\", Desilu—the show's production company—made a decision on what should be done with the wasted footage from the unused pilot movie.\n",
      "Incorporating \"The Cage\" into the two-part episode, \"The Menagerie\", was actually a solution to a large and growing problem with the show's production. Its special effects, unprecedented for a weekly television production, were causing delays in the completion of each episode. The problem was cumulative, with shows getting delivered to NBC later and later.\n",

The episode was the first professional work of writer David Gerrold, and went through a variety of drafts before it reached the screen. Due to an error in the size of typeface, an approved version needed to be reduced by twenty pages before filming. Nichelle Nichols remarked that she had \"never seen a script go through so many changes—and stay so much the same\". \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" was one of several episodes directed by Joseph Pevney, who was one of the most prolific directors of the series.\n",

Uhura a tribble, with dramatic consequences.

      "Description: The Enterprise picks up a crew of genetic supermen from the 20th century...and their leader, Khan, plans to create a new empire.\n",
      "Description: \"Space Seed\" is an episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek. It is the 22nd episode of the first season and was first broadcast by NBC on February 16, 1967. \"Space Seed\" was written by Gene L. Coon and Carey Wilber and directed by Marc Daniels. Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet starship USS Enterprise under Captain James T. Kirk. In this episode, the crew of the Enterprise encounter a sleeper ship holding genetically-engineered supermen and women from Earth's war-torn past. The supermen's leader, Khan Noonien Singh, attempts to take control of the Enterprise to begin a new conquest. The episode also guest stars Madlyn Rhue as Lt. Marla McGivers, who becomes romantically involved with Khan.\n",
      "The general plot had originally been created by Wilber for the series Captain Video and His Video Rangers which featured humans from Ancient Greece who were preserved in cryogenic suspension and resurrected. During the conception and writing of the episode numerous changes were made as producer Bob Justman felt that it would be too expensive to film.\n",

The story premise was written by Joseph Stefano, and the screenplay was re-written by Hannah Louise Shearer. The episode was directed by Joseph L. Scanlan.\n",
      "The series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise races to rescue Deanna Troi from a crashed shuttle, which is being held captive by an alien life form called Armus. In investigating the crash, Lieutenant Tasha Yar is killed by Armus, and Troi is eventually rescued after Captain Picard distracts the alien.\n",
      "Yar's death in the episode was the result of Crosby asking to be released from her contract, although her last filmed episode was actually \"Symbiosis\" as it was filmed subsequent to \"Skin of Evil\". The manner of her death was intended to be typical of the threat posed to a security officer, and was what the show's creator Gene Roddenberry had intended.\n",

      "Description: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is a 1982 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures. The film is the second feature based on the Star Trek science fiction franchise. The plot features Admiral James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship USS Enterprise facing off against the genetically-engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh, a character who first appeared in the 1967 Star Trek television series episode \"Space Seed\". When Khan escapes from a 15-year exile to exact revenge on Kirk, the crew of the Enterprise must stop him from acquiring a powerful terraforming device named Genesis. The film concludes with the death of Enterprise's captain, Spock, beginning a story arc that continues with the 1984 film Star Trek III: The Search for Spock and concludes with 1986's Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.\n",
      "After the lackluster critical and commercial response to Star Trek: The Motion Picture, series creator Gene Roddenberry was forced out of the sequel's production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film's original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed into a full script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed the final script in 12 days, without accepting a writing credit.\n",

      "Description: \"Where No One Has Gone Before\" is the sixth episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, originally aired October 16, 1987 in broadcast syndication in the United States. A high-definition, remastered version of the episode received limited theatrical release for one day to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series on July 23, 2012. The story was originally developed with the title \"Where None Have Gone Before\" and was based on Diane Duane's book, The Wounded Sky. Duane and Michael Reaves pitched the idea to David Gerrold and Gene Roddenberry, and then submitted a script. Their script was subsequently rewritten by Maurice Hurley, whose first effort was poorly received; however, his rewritten version was filmed. The episode was the first of the series directed by Rob Bowman, who went on to direct twelve more episodes.\n",

It is the eighth feature film in the Star Trek science fiction franchise and the first film to feature no cast members from the original Star Trek television series of the 1960s. The primary cast for First Contact is from the Star Trek: The Next Generation television series, to which the film's producers added Alice Krige, Neal McDonough, James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard. In the film's plot, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E travel from the 24th to 21st century to save their future after the cybernetic Borg conquered Earth by changing the timeline.\n",
      "After the release of the seventh film, Star Trek Generations, in 1994, Paramount tasked writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore with developing a sequel. Braga and Moore wanted to feature the Borg in the plot, while producer Rick Berman wanted a story involving time travel. The writers combined the two ideas; they initially set the film during the European Renaissance, but changed the time period the Borg corrupted to the mid-21st century after fearing the Renaissance idea would be too kitsch.\n",

In this episode, the crew rescue three Klingon from a damaged freighter in the neutral zone. Once aboard they befriend Lt. Worf and attempt to hijack the Enterprise so they can live as true Klingons, forcing Worf to choose between them or Starfleet.\n",
      "The episode explained the backstory to the character of Lt. Worf, and Michael Dorn was pleased with the outcome. Rob Bowman thought that the episode worked well. He included an overhead shot on the engineering set which had not been done before on the show and tweaked the ending. Shots of the Klingon starship were reused from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, while the freighter model would be reused as various freighters throughout the various Star Trek television series.\n",

      "The episode was written after executive producer Maurice Hurley worked on Miami Vice, which he credited for resulting in a narcotic theme in the episode. The guest cast included Judson Scott and Merritt Butrick who had both appeared in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. \"Symbiosis\" marked the final filmed appearance of Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar until her return in \"Yesterday's Enterprise\".

      "Description: Star Trek: Nemesis is a 2002 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures. It is the tenth feature film in the Star Trek franchise and the last of the Star Trek films to include the entire main cast of the Star Trek: The Next Generation television series. It was directed by Stuart Baird and written by John Logan. The crew of the USS Enterprise-E are forced to deal with a threat to the United Federation of Planets from a Reman clone of Captain Picard named Shinzon who has taken control of the Romulan Star Empire in a coup d'état.\n",
      "Principal photography took place from November 2001 to March 2002. Jerry Goldsmith composed the film's score. The film was released in North America on December 13, 2002. The film received generally mixed reviews, with publications criticizing the film for being the least successful in the Star Trek franchise. The film went on to earn $67,312,826 worldwide, making it a box office disappointment. Following the failure of the film and the cancellation of Star Trek: Enterprise, Berman and Erik Jendresen began development on the unproduced Star Trek: The Beginning.\n",

At various times the \"fight or flight\" instinct is shown as an internal battle which one has to overcome in order to find emotional peace.\n",

      "Description: Star Trek III: The Search for Spock is a 1984 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures. The film is the third feature film of the Star Trek science fiction franchise and is the center of a three-film story arc that begins with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and concludes with Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. After the death of Spock the crew of the USS Enterprise returns to Earth. When James T. Kirk learns that Spock's spirit, or katra, is held in the mind of Dr. Leonard \"Bones\" McCoy, Kirk and company steal the Enterprise to return Spock's body to his home planet. The crew must also contend with hostile Klingons, led by Kruge, bent on stealing the secrets of a powerful terraforming device.\n",
      "Paramount commissioned the film after positive critical and commercial reaction to The Wrath of Khan. Nimoy directed, the first Star Trek cast member to do so. Producer Harve Bennett wrote the script starting from the end and working back, and intended the destruction of the Enterprise to be a shocking development.\n",

The 22nd episode of the fourth season and the 98th of the series overall, it first aired on May 13, 2005, in the United States. The story takes place concurrently with the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"The Pegasus\", set in the year 2370, in which Commander William Riker grapples with making a difficult admission to his commanding officer about a cover-up. Riker visits the holodeck and turns to the events of the 22nd century for guidance, where the crew of Star Trek: Enterprise travels home to Earth for the signing of the Articles of Federation and formation of the United Federation of Planets.\n",
      "After a strong premiere, Enterprise had grappled with declining ratings throughout its run. By the fourth season, fewer than three million viewers tuned in each week despite what some fans and critics considered an increase in episode quality. After selling the syndication rights, UPN and Paramount announced in February 2005 that the fourth season would be the show's last.\n",

      "The series is set in the nearby regions of the Milky Way galaxy; the first season takes place in the year 2364, 100 years after the start of the five-year mission of the Enterprise described in the original series, which began in 2264. It features a new crew and a new starship Enterprise. Patrick Stewart's voice-over introduction during each episode's opening credits stated the starship's purpose, updated from the original to represent an open-ended \"mission\", and to be gender-neutral:\n",
      "Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.\n",

      "Description: Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is a science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe.\n",
      "The show is set in the Milky Way galaxy, in the years 2369 – 2375. In contrast to the setting of the other Star Trek TV shows, it takes place on a space station instead of a starship, so as not to have two series with starships at the same time. This made continuing story arcs and the appearance of recurring characters much more feasible. The show is noted for its well-developed characters, its original, complex plots, religious themes and for starring the only African American captain of all the Star Trek series to be featured as the show's protagonist. The series concentrated on darker themes, less physical exploration of space, and an emphasis on many aspects of war.\n",
      "DS9 premiered in 1993 and ran for seven seasons until 1999. Rooted in Gene Roddenberry’s Star Trek universe, it was the first Trek spin-off created without direct involvement from Roddenberry, although he did give his blessing to the concept shortly before his death in 1991. The series was created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller, at the request of Brandon Tartikoff, and was produced by Paramount Television.\n",

      "Description: \"The Battle\" is the ninth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation and was originally aired on November 16, 1987 in broadcast syndication. The episode was written by Herbert Wright, based on a story by Larry Forrester, and directed by Rob Bowman.\n",
      "Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Captain Jean-Luc Picard is given his former vessel, the Stargazer, as a gift by the Ferengi DaiMon Bok who intends to use it to take revenge upon the Enterprise captain.\n",
      "The Stargazer was to originally be represented by the movie-era Enterprise model, but producers were convinced to use a design which had appeared on a model in Picard's ready room in the series pilot. Several camera and compositing techniques were used by Bowman in filming the scenes aboard the bridge of the Stargazer, which was also a re-dressed movie-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge set. Reception to the episode overall was mixed, but reviewers agreed that the performance of Patrick Stewart stood out for good reason.\n",

The only other episode with such an honor is the two-part episode \"The Menagerie\". The teleplay is credited to Harlan Ellison, but was also largely rewritten by several authors before filming.

      "A rift in the space/time continuum brings the U.S.S. Enterprise - C forward into the 24th Century, and alters the timeline. In this future, the Federation is at war with the Klingons, Tasha Yar is on the bridge, Worf did not join the Federation, and only Guinan's unique perception of reality may restore the timeline.\n",
      "Description: \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" is the 63rd episode of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was the 15th episode of the third season. The episode first aired in syndication the week of February 19, 1990. In the plot, the crew of the USS Enterprise-D must decide whether to send the time-travelling Enterprise-C back through a temporal rift to its certain destruction in order to prevent their own disastrous timeline from ever occurring.\n",
      "The plot for \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" came from the uniting of two story ideas; one which featured the crew of the time-travelling Enterprise-C, and another episode which featured the return of Denise Crosby, whose character had been killed in the show's first season. Trent Christopher Ganino and Eric A. Stillwell rewrote the story to more prominently feature the character of Guinan, and the script was completed by a team of five writers.\n",
      "Filming of the episode lasted a week; some planned elements, including death scenes for many of the characters, were either too time-intensive or costly to film.\n",

      "Description: Star Trek is a 2009 science fiction film directed by J. J. Abrams, written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and produced by Damon Lindelof and Bryan Burk. It is the eleventh film based on the Star Trek franchise that was created by Gene Roddenberry and features the main characters of the original Star Trek series, who are portrayed by a new cast. With one original cast member appearing in the film (Leonard Nimoy) as Spock prime.  It explores the back stories of James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) , Spock (Zachary Quinto), and Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban) before they unite aboard the USS Enterprise to combat Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan from the future who threatens the United Federation of Planets. The film was released in conventional theaters and some IMAX theaters on May 8, 2009, following a limited number of advanced screenings starting at 7pm the night before. Star Trek screenings grossed an Imax record of $8.5 million during the film's first weekend. Development of the film began in 2005 when Paramount Pictures contacted Abrams, Orci and Kurtzman for ideas to revive the franchise. The creative team contrasted Orci and Lindelof, who consider themselves \"Trekkies\", with casual fans like Abrams, who all aimed to create a film that would interest a general audience. The film payed tribute to original Cannon by featuring several cliché one liners by the new actors that were a staple of the original franchise. Paramount pushed back the release of the film from Dec. 25 to May 8, 2009, saying the picture's gross potential is greater as a summer film. Elements of the writer's favorite novels were included, and modified continuity with the time-travel storyline, a modernized bridge along with the production design of the original show. Filming took place from November 2007 to March 2008 under intense secrecy.\n",

The film follows James T. Kirk and Spock aboard the USS Enterprise as they combat Nero, a Romulan from their future who threatens the United Federation of Planets. The story takes place in an alternate reality due to time travel by both Nero and the original Spock. The alternate timeline was created in an effort to free the film and the franchise from established continuity constraints while simultaneously preserving original story elements.\n",
      "Development for Star Trek originated in 1968, when creator Gene Roddenberry announced plans to produce a prequel modeled after the television series.\n",

Kirk beams over to the Defiant with a boarding party to investigate and finds the entire crew dead. What's more, the Defiant seems to be trapped in an interphase between two different universes. A power loss partially disables the Enterprise transporter, but the landing party manages to beam back to the Enterprise except Kirk who suddenly disappears along with the Defiant. Spock calculates that the next time to interphase will be approximately two hours, and that the captain can be rescued at that time.

The language's basic sound, along with a few words, was first devised by actor James Doohan for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. That film marked the first time the language had been heard on screen. In all previous appearances, Klingons spoke in English. Klingon was subsequently developed by Okrand into a full-fledged language.\n",
      "Klingon is sometimes referred to as Klingonese but, among the Klingon-speaking community, this is often understood to refer to another Klingon language called Klingonaase that was introduced in John M. Ford's 1984 Star Trek novel The Final Reflection, and appears in other Star Trek novels by Ford. A shorthand version of Klingonaase, and later with the same term adopted by tlhIngan Hol itself, is called \"battle language\", or \"Clipped Klingon\".\n",

      "Description: Stardate 1533.6: The Enterprise makes a rendezvous with the S.S. Antares and picks up a 17 year old boy, Charlie Evans who is the only survivor of a colony expedition that crashed on the planet Thasus. Captain Ramart and his staff rave about the boy, but Kirk can't help but be puzzled when Ramart refuses luxury items and hurries back to the Antares. Charlie, without social skills of any measure, seems a bit strange and unrefined but states that he grew up alone with only the record tapes from the wreckage for company. Sometime later, Captain Ramart signals the Enterprise and tries to warn Kirk about something, but just then the Antares is destroyed. Kirk doesn't think much about Charlie's disinterested reaction to the deaths of his former friends, but Spock begins to suspect that there is more to the boy than they know. This is confirmed when Charlie makes a crewman disappear for laughing at him while in the gym. During this time, Charlie becomes infatuated with the first ^girl^ he saw after coming aboard the Enterprise, Yeoman Rand. Unable to control his desires, Charlie pesters Rand until she is forced to hurt him, first by rejecting the boy and then by slapping him while in her quarters. This, of course, causes Charlie to make her disappear as well. Now realizing the full extent of Charlie's powers and the danger he could pose to civilization, Kirk tries to alter the ship's course away from their next stop, Colony 5, but Charlie learns of his plans, seizes control of the Enterprise, and locks in a course for Colony 5. By this time the Thasians, noncorporeal beings who really raised Charlie and gave him his powers, discover that the boy is missing and intercept the Enterprise. Despite Charlie's pleas not to be taken away, the Thasians remove Charlie from the Enterprise and restore the crew back to normal.\n",

The animated series was aired under the name Star Trek, but it has become widely known under this longer name to differentiate it from the original live-action Star Trek. The success in syndication of the original live action series and fan pressure for a Star Trek revival led to The Animated Series from 1973–1974, as the source of new adventures of the Enterprise crew, the next being the 1979 live-action feature film Star Trek: The Motion Picture.\n",
      "The Animated Series was the original cast's last episodic portrayal of the characters until the \"cartoon like\" graphics of the Star Trek: 25th Anniversary computer game in 1992, as well as its sequel Star Trek: Judgment Rites in 1993, both of which appeared after the cast's last movie together in 1991's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. The series was critically acclaimed and was the first Star Trek series to win an Emmy Award.\n",

It is the fourth feature film in the film series and completes the story arc begun in The Wrath of Khan and continued in The Search for Spock. Intent on returning home to Earth to face trial for their crimes, the former crew of the USS Enterprise finds the planet in grave danger from an alien probe attempting to contact now-extinct humpback whales. The crew travel to Earth's past to find whales who can answer the probe's call.\n",
      "After directing The Search for Spock, cast member Leonard Nimoy was asked to direct the next feature, and given greater freedom regarding the film's content. Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett conceived a story with an environmental message and no clear-cut villain. Dissatisfied with the first screenplay produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes, Paramount hired The Wrath of Khan writer and director Nicholas Meyer. Meyer and Bennett divided the story between them and wrote different parts of the script, requiring approval from Nimoy, lead actor William Shatner, and Paramount.\n",

      "\n",
      "Description: Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is a 1989 American science-fiction film released by Paramount Pictures. It is the fifth feature in the franchise and the penultimate to star the cast of the original Star Trek science fiction television series. Taking place shortly after the events of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, the plot follows the crew of the USS Enterprise-A as they confront a renegade Vulcan, Sybok, who is searching for God at the center of the galaxy.\n",
      "The film was directed by cast member William Shatner, following two films directed by his co-star, Leonard Nimoy. Shatner also developed the initial storyline in which Sybok searches for God but instead finds an alien being. Series creator Gene Roddenberry disliked the original script, while Nimoy and DeForest Kelley objected to the premise that their characters, Spock and Leonard McCoy, would betray Shatner's James T. Kirk. The script went through multiple revisions to please the cast and studio, including cuts in the effects-laden climax of the film. Despite a writers' guild strike cutting into the film's pre-production, Paramount commenced filming in October 1988.\n",

      "Description: \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" is the second pilot episode of the science fiction television series Star Trek. It was produced in 1965 after the first pilot, \"The Cage\", had been rejected by NBC. Reportedly, Lucille Ball, who owned Desilu Studios, persuaded NBC management to consider a second pilot, thereby exercising a special option agreement it had with Desilu, because she liked Gene Roddenberry and believed in the project. The episode was eventually broadcast third in sequence on September 22, 1966, and re-aired on April 20, 1967. On July 12, 1969, it was the first episode to be shown in the UK by the BBC.\n",
      "\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was written by Samuel A. Peeples, directed by James Goldstone, and filmed in July 1965. It was the first episode of Star Trek to feature William Shatner as Captain James Kirk, James Doohan as Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, and George Takei as Lt. Sulu. The episode title was adopted as the final phrase in the opening voice-over which characterizes the series and has entered popular culture, though the voice-over debuts in the first season premiere \"The Corbomite Maneuver\".\n",

      "Description: In the fictitious universe of Star Trek, the Prime Directive is the guiding principle of the United Federation of Planets. The Prime Directive, used in four out of five Star Trek-based series, prohibits Starfleet personnel from interfering with the internal development of alien civilizations. This conceptual law applies particularly to civilizations which are below a certain threshold of technological, scientific and cultural development; preventing starship crews from using their superior technology to impose their own values or ideals on them. Since its introduction in the first season of the original Star Trek series, it has served as the focus of numerous episodes of the various series. As time-travel became a recurring feature in the franchise, the concept was expanded as a Temporal Prime Directive, prohibiting those under its orders from interfering in historical events.\n",

Our destination is planet Deneb IV...\" While the general idea resembles the Julian day currently used by astronomers, writers and producers have selected numbers using different methods over the years, some more arbitrary than others.

      "Description: Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is a 1991 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures. It is the sixth installment in the Star Trek franchise and was directed by Nicholas Meyer and written by Meyer with Denny Martin Flinn. After the destruction of the moon Praxis leads the Klingon Empire to pursue peace with their long-time adversary the Federation, the crew of the USS Enterprise must race against unseen conspirators with a militaristic agenda.\n",
      "The Undiscovered Country was initially planned as a prequel to the original series, with younger actors portraying the crew of the Enterprise while attending Starfleet Academy, but the idea was discarded because of negative reaction from the cast and the fans. Faced with producing a new film in time for Star Trek '​s 25th anniversary, Flinn and Meyer, the director of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, wrote a script based on a suggestion from Leonard Nimoy about what would happen if \"the wall came down in space\", touching on the contemporary events of the Cold War.\n",
      "Principal photography took place between April and September 1991.\n",

      "Description: In the mirror universe, Commander Archer mutinies against Captain Forrest in order to capture a future Earth ship found in Tholian space.\n",
      "Description: \"In a Mirror, Darkly\" is the eighteenth and nineteenth episodes of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: Enterprise, and originally aired on April 22 and 29, 2005. This installment was developed to be a sequel to The Original Series episode \"The Tholian Web\" and a prequel to \"Mirror, Mirror\". The decision to set an Enterprise episode in the mirror universe originated with a pitch to enable William Shatner to appear in the series. The teleplays for both parts of the episode were written by Mike Sussman, with Manny Coto contributing the story for the second part.\n",
      "Set in the 22nd century, the series normally follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise, registration NX-01. However, these installments feature a mirror universe Jonathan Archer and his crew. The mirror universe features evil counterparts of the normal characters, who serve the cruel and militaristic Terran Empire. In the first part, the ISS Enterprise encounters a Starfleet ship from the future of the main universe which is being stripped for parts by the Tholians, and seeks to take the ship from the aliens.\n",

In this episode, Q returns to the USS Enterprise following his original encounter with the crew in \"Encounter at Farpoint\". Q transports the bridge crew to a landscape where they are attacked by humanoids and grants Commander Riker the powers of a member of the Q Continuum, which he is forced to use to resurrect both Worf and Wesley. Riker promises never to use the powers again, but after a rescue mission he breaks down and grants each of the bridge crew a wish, which they refuse, with Riker subsequently rejecting his new powers. Q is recalled to the Continuum in failure.\n",

      "Description: \"The Neutral Zone\" is the 26th episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, originally aired within the United States on May 16, 1988 in broadcast syndication. The episode originated as a piece of fan fiction by Deborah McIntyre and Mona Clee, and was turned into a teleplay by Maurice Hurley. Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, Hurley created the script in a day and a half, and the timescale forced both the abandonment of the idea of a two-part episode and the first appearance of the Borg which was delayed until the following season episode \"Q Who\".\n",
      "Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship USS Enterprise-D. In \"The Neutral Zone\", the Enterprise is sent to investigate the destruction of Federation outposts near space controlled by the Romulan Star Empire, discovering a derelict Earth satellite with cryonically frozen humans aboard.\n",

      "The first series, now referred to as \"The Original Series\", debuted in 1966 and ran for three seasons on NBC. It followed the interstellar adventures of James T. Kirk and the crew of the starship Enterprise, an exploration vessel of a 23rd-century interstellar \"United Federation of Planets\". In creating the first \"Star Trek\", Roddenberry was inspired by Westerns such as Wagon Train, along with the Horatio Hornblower novels and Gulliver's Travels. These adventures continued in the short-lived Star Trek: The Animated Series and six feature films.\n",

It is episode #65, production #67, written by Meyer Dolinsky, and directed by David Alexander. This episode is one of the first scripted American television broadcasts to depict an inter-racial kiss between a white man and a black woman. This episode was withdrawn by the BBC in the UK because of 'sadistic plot elements' during the initial run in 1971 and was not shown until a repeat run in January 1994.\n",

The story was created by Robert Lewin and Maurice Hurley, and turned into a script by Lewin and the creator of the show, Gene Roddenberry. It was Roddenberry's final script credit on a Star Trek series. The director was originally to be Joe Scanlan, but following delays in pre-production caused by script re-writes, it was reassigned to Rob Bowman.\n",

      "The story underwent significant changes prior to filming, with it originally meant to be a romance episode for Data with a female android. It was then altered to an \"evil twin\" plot at the suggestion of Spiner and elements of Data's origin were introduced, first as an alien creation and then at the hands of Dr. Noonien Soong.\n",

      "Description: \"Home Soil\" is the 18th episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. It first aired in broadcast syndication on February 22, 1988. Robert Sabaroff, Karl Geurs and Ralph Sanchez developed the story, with Sabaroff producing the teleplay. \"Home Soil\" is one of five episodes of the series directed by Corey Allen.\n",
      "Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew on the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In the episode, the crew of the Enterprise investigate the murder of a crewman on a terraforming colony and discover a crystalline life form possessing intelligence.\n",
      "The production team encountered problems with the sets, casting, and scheduling. Due to issues with the script, it was delivered to Allen just one day before shooting. Nine million viewers watched the episode, the second lowest number of viewers for the first season of The Next Generation. Critical reception was mixed, with one reviewer noting that unlike the original Star Trek series, \"Home Soil\" explored the realm of hard science fiction.\n",

It was first broadcast on February 1, 1988 in the United States in broadcast syndication. It was written by Maurice Hurley and Robert Lewin, and directed by Paul Lynch.\n",
      "Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, members of an alien race called the Bynars hijack a nearly evacuated Enterprise while retrofitting the computer in space dock.\n",
      "Make-up supervisor Michael Westmore created the look of the Bynars, who were four women in extensive make-up. The musical score was scored by Ron Jones. Reviewers praised the Bynars themselves, and the response to the episode was generally positive, with one critic calling it the best of the season. It was awarded an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.\n",
